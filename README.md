Hi, this is my second React JS practice project. I used JSX, Tailwind CSS and React icons(Font Awesome) for the whole project. 
Under App.js, these three files are in the 'src's airbnb file. They are what will appear when pulled since they are the main export of the parent component imported into index.js 
FOR REFERENCE - (these three below)
import Navbar from './airbnb/navbar';
import Hero from './airbnb/middle';
import Bottom from './airbnb/bottom';
